# Understanding Beech Leaf Disease (BLD) — Data Story

A short, scroll-based visual data story about **Beech Leaf Disease**—what it is, how to recognize it, why it matters, and where it’s spreading.

**Live site:** https://scheuermann-daniel.github.io/BLD-Data-Story/

## What’s inside
- Intro “search” animation + guided scroll experience
- BLD overview (nematode cause), symptoms, ecological/economic impacts
- Regional context maps + spread timeline section
- Simple JS effects (fade-ins, carousel)

## Built with
- HTML + CSS (single-page layout)
- Vanilla JavaScript (scroll/fade effects + carousel)
- Visualizations developed with ArcGIS

## Run locally
Just open `index.html` in your browser (or serve the folder if your browser blocks local assets).

## Future Work
Right now the site is rudimentary. I would like to go into further analysis on which replacements for the Beech would be best and why.

I would also like to make the page more professional given the chance, as the animations could use some work.
